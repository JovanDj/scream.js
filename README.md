# Scream.ts: A Modern TypeScript Framework for Node.js

Welcome to the official documentation for scream.ts, a pioneering TypeScript framework designed from the ground up to transform the way developers approach Node.js backend development. Embracing the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), SOLID, the Law of Demeter, and favoring composition over inheritance, scream.ts provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution for building modern web applications.

## Introduction

scream.ts was conceived out of a desire to address and alleviate common frustrations encountered in backend development. By marrying the latest advancements in Node.js with the powerful features of TypeScript, scream.ts offers developers a comprehensive toolkit that prioritizes type safety, code quality, and developer efficiency.

### Core Principles

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** scream.ts leverages OOP to structure applications in a way that is both intuitive and aligned with real-world models, enhancing code reusability and readability.
- **SOLID Principles:** At the heart of scream.ts's design philosophy are the SOLID principles, ensuring that the framework and applications built with it are flexible, extendable, and easy to maintain.
- **Law of Demeter:** scream.ts advocates for minimal coupling between components, leading to a more modular and less interdependent codebase.
- **Composition Over Inheritance:** By emphasizing composition, scream.ts enables more flexible code structures and avoids the complexities associated with deep inheritance hierarchies.

## Embracing the Latest Node.js LTS Version

scream.ts aligns with the latest Node.js LTS version, tapping into the stability, performance enhancements, and security improvements it offers. This commitment ensures that scream.ts applications are built on a solid and modern foundation, ready to meet the demands of today's web development landscape.

## TypeScript: The Language of Choice

The decision to use TypeScript exclusively underlines scream.ts's commitment to enhancing the developer experience through improved code quality, early error detection, and a more expressive coding environment. The strictest TypeScript settings are employed to ensure that no compile-time errors slip into the final build, fostering a culture of excellence and attention to detail.

## Architectural Highlights

### Modular Architecture

scream.ts is designed with modularity at its core, facilitating easy swapping and upgrading of components. This approach significantly reduces the time and effort required to adapt to new technologies or replace parts of an application, embodying the framework's commitment to flexibility and future-proofing.

#### HTTP Interface and Adapters

A standout feature of scream.ts is its HTTP interface, offering first-party adapters for popular frameworks like Express and Koa. This allows developers to seamlessly interchange these frameworks with minimal effort, demonstrating scream.ts's adaptability and focus on developer convenience.

#### DataMapper and Repository Pattern

Choosing the DataMapper pattern over Active Record, scream.ts promotes a separation of concerns between the business logic and the persistence layer. This design choice, complemented by the Repository pattern, enhances flexibility, scalability, and testability, allowing developers to use any database system within a repository and implement the DataMapper using any database library, with a prebuilt implementation available in knex.js.

### Strict Constructor Dependency Injection

scream.ts employs strict constructor dependency injection, foregoing the use of an injection container to maintain simplicity and type safety. This decision ensures a clear and manageable application structure, reinforcing the framework's dedication to transparency and modularity.

## Code Quality and Consistency

scream.ts advocates for uniform coding standards through the integration of Prettier and a custom ESLint configuration, coupled with strict TypeScript compiler settings. This commitment to code quality and consistency aids in creating a coherent development ecosystem where developers can effortlessly transition between scream.ts projects.

### Default Prettier Settings and Custom ESLint Configuration

The adoption of default Prettier settings and a custom ESLint configuration enforces a consistent code style and best practices across the scream.ts community. This approach minimizes cognitive overhead for developers and fosters a collaborative environment where code quality is paramount.

## Conclusion

scream.ts is more than a framework; it's a movement towards a more rational, enjoyable, and high-quality approach to backend development. By adhering to best practices in software design, emphasizing type safety, and fostering a modular and adaptable architecture, scream.ts empowers developers to build sophisticated, maintainable, and scalable web applications.
